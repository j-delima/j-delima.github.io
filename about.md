Hello, you've reached my blog. I'm Jon, I'm an All-source Intelligence Technician in the U.S. Army.

I'm currently in grad school, attempting to obtain a masters in analytics through Georgia Tech.

I'm still thinking about what to put here, but I like the lists below... so, still under construction.

Things that I'm currently reading:

* Testing an asteriks
* Testing another
  
Things that I'm currently working on:

* I wonder what this will look like
* Or how about this one?
