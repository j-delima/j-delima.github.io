## Introduction

I want to be a writer (at least I think I do). Following a deployment to Iraq in 2022, I knew I wanted to publish an article to capture the way we applied data analysis and data literacy in our formation. We returned home late-December 2022. My co-author and I took an official trip to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency in late February 2023 to share our findings. It was during this trip that a majority of our <a href="https://mipb.army.mil/articles/jul-dec-2024/bridging-gap">article</a> was written. It took almost a year and a half to finally get published in the Military Intelligence Professional Bulletin.  While the accomplishment was still gratifying, the length of time from idea to publication left me with an anxiety- a feeling that my thoughts were racing against time and currency. 

In my current job as an Observer, Coach, Trainer at the Joint Readiness Training Center in Fort Johnson, LA, I find myself with even more ideas fueled by thoughtful discussion and hours of observation that should be captured in some form. My first knee-jerk reaction was a podcast, but everyone has one and there are too many out there (I barely have time to listen to all the shows I'm currently subscribed to). Then serendipitously, I was introduced to the <a href="https://mwi.westpoint.edu/introducing-the-harding-project-renewing-professional-military-writing/">Harding Project</a>. I was overjoyed to see the revitalization of professional writing and the work to take advantage of writing in a digital medium. That brings us to this blog. First and foremost, it is easier to produce. Second, it cuts the anxiety of waiting for publication. I can seek reviews on my time and publish on my pace and jumpstart discussion faster.

## Disruption and Discourse

So why the title?

The tactical purpose of a disrupt is to create an effect "to cause the enemy to break up its formation and tempo, interrupt its timetable [...]." (FM 3-90, Tactics)

Merriam-Webster defines discourse as "formal and orderly and usually extended expression of thought on a subject." 

Now I would never want you- reader- to be my enemy, but I think it would be great to converse with you on the other side of a thoughtful debate. So, I hope you find a post here that slows you down, makes you take a tactical pause, and hopefully generates some new ideas. Then beyond that, I hope we can engage and push the discourse even further to keep the discussion alive.
